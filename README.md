# Archery Console Game: Two-Player Obstacle Course

## Overview

This project was developed as a degree project for the course Programming Principles 2021 at UdelaR, Uruguay.

This game is a two-player obstacle course that is deployed on the console. The game board is a 10x10 grid with random obstacles scattered throughout. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the end of the course without colliding with any obstacles.

## Requirements
To play this game, you will need a console that supports C++ programming language.

## Installation
To install the game, download the source code and compile it on your local machine using a C++ compiler. Once compiled, you can run the game executable from the command line.

## How to Play
The game is played with two players taking turns moving their characters across the game board. Each player can move their character up, down, left, or right by one square per turn. However, if a player collides with an obstacle, they lose the game and the other player wins.

The game board is randomly generated at the start of each game, so no two games are the same. This adds an element of surprise and strategy to the gameplay.

To start the game, simply run the executable from the command line and follow the on-screen instructions.
